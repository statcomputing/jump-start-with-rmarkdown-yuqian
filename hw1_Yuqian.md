    This is the first homework for STAT5361 Statistical Computat     ion which is 
    designed for getting familiar with RMarkdown. In this homework, I will 
    approximate one integration by Monte Carlo method with sampling 
    from Normal distribution function N(0,1). The experiments would be 
    conducted at 3 different sample sizes, with 9 different upper limits. 
    The key-step derivation and results will be presented. Ture values will
    also be calculated as reference.
